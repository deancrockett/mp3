QUESTION 1:
These 11 lines are performing a check-and-add function that is repeated later in another method.
These lines can easily be refactored by copying them to a new public method in the same file.
This method is called tryAddPluginToMap() and has 2 parameters, for the pluginmap and an iterative variable for the plugin.

QUESTION 3:
This new method updateAndTrim currently still belongs to the Nodes class.
We can refactor this by extracting the method to another class, and by calling the method within the Nodes class as a method of jenkins (jenkins.updateAndTrim() rather than updateAndTrim)
